Welcome to Lights Out!

The game takes place on a n*n grid of lights,
where a light is either on or off.

If you flick a light that is on, you'll turn it
off - and vice versa.

The flicking of a light does not only affect the
light itself, but also its adjacent lights.

REGULAR MODE:
If you play in the regular mode, only the lights
(not counting in the diagonal directions) directly
adjacent to the flicked light are regarded as adjacent.

UNLIMITED MODE:
In the unlimited mode, all lights on the same row or
column as a flicked light are regarded as adjacent lights.

GOAL OF THE GAME
The goal of the game is to flick the lights until all lights
are off! Good luck!
